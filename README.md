# SudokuSolver
A program to play and solve any Sudoku

This program is currently functional, however there isn't an interface, or a dynamic method to setup the inital suduko other than manually edditing the variables. Next steps is to create a GUI that can be used to both set up the inital puzzle, as well as to be able to visuallize the back tracking in progress.
